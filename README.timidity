  later version.

  The original version of this program was written by Tuuka Tiovonen
  <tt@cgs.fi> until TiMidity 0.2i (he discontinued development
  because he was too busy with work). Masanao Izumo <mo@goice.co.jp> and
  other people began to hack it, then we officially released the new
  version, which is called TiMidity++.

  TiMidity was originally a converter that converted MIDI files to WAV
  audio files. But now TiMidity++ is not only a converter but also a
  real-time player that can play a MIDI file in real time. TiMidity does
  not requires an external MIDI instrument module to play MIDI file; it can
  perform with software power only.

  TiMidity++ uses GUS/patch (Glavis Ultrasound) as the voice data to play.
  It can also handle SoundFont data for voice data.

*Features of TiMidity++:
  - Plays MIDI files without external MIDI instruments
  - Converts MIDI files to various audio file formats
    (ex. wav, au, etc.)
  - Uses GUS/patch and SoundFont for voice data
  - Displays some information about the music data during playback
  - Various user interfaces are available (ncurses, motif, xaw, etc..)
  - Plays MIDI files over a network
  - Plays MIDI files in archive files
  - Plays not only SMF files but also MOD, RCP/R36/G18/G36
  - Can handle 32 channel data
  - Can handle user interfaces as dynamically linked modules
  - Can display a sound spectrogram
  - Automatically detects the mode of a MIDI file (GM/GS/XG)
  - Automatically detects drum channels (GS/XG)
  - Trace playing
  - Low load
  - The following MIDI events are supported:
    NoteOn/Off, KeyPressure, Program, ChannelPressure, Pitchwheel,
    ToneBank, ModulationWheel, MainVolume, Panning, Expression,
    Sustain, Portamento, DataEntry, ReverbEffect, ChorusEffect,
    RPN+/-, NRPN, RPN, AllSoundsOff, ResetControllers, AllNotesOff,
    Mono/Poly Part, RandomPan, KeyShift,
    TempoChange, Lyric, InsertText, KARAOKE-Part(@KMIDI),
    MasterVolume, MIDI-Reset, SystemExclusiveMessages

*Usage:
  -format: timidity [options] midi-filenames

  -option:
      -A amplification
              Multiplies  the  master  volume by amplification %.
              Default value is 70%.  The grater number of  amplification
              makes louder sounds.  Range of the amplification is from 0 to 800%.

      -a      Turns on anti-aliasing. Samples are  run  through  a
              low-pass filter before playing, which reduces aliasing
              noise at low resampling frequencies.

      -B fragments
              For the Linux /  FreeBSD  /  OSS  /  Windows  sound
              driver,  selects  the  number  of buffer  fragments
              in interactive  mode.   Increasing  the  number  of
              fragments  may  reduce  choppiness  when many  proc-
              esses are running.  It will make TiMidity++ seem  to
              respond  sluggishly  to  fast  forward, rewind, and
              volume  controls, and  it  will  throw  the  status
              display off sync.  Specify a fragments of 0 to  use
              the maximum number of fragments available.

      -b mode

              Enables pseudo surround effects.   mode  parameters
              are the following:
              -bl    Sounds are comes mainly from left.
              -br    Sounds are comes mainly from right.
              -bb    Sounds are comes left and right in random.
              -bc    Disables this feature.

      -C ratio
              Sets the ratio of sampling and control frequencies.
              This determines how often  envelopes  are  recalcu-
              lated  -- small ratios yield better quality but use
              more CPU time.

      -c filename
              Reads an extra configuration file.

      -D channel
              Marks channel as a drum  channel.   If  channel  is
              negative,  channel -channel is marked as an instru-
              mental channel.  If channel is 0, all channels  are
              marked as instrumental.

      -d dir  Specifies the directory contains installed dynamic-
              link interface modules.


      -e      Make   TiMidity++   evil.   On  Win32  version,  this
              increases the task priority by  one.  It  can  give
              better  playback  when  you  switch  tasks  at  the
              expense of slowing all other tasks down.

      -E mode
              Set  TiMidity++ extend modes. The following modes are
              available (capitalized switch  means  disable  this
              feature):
              w/W    Enables/disables modulation controlling.
              p/P    Enables/disables portamento controlling.
              v/V    Enables/disables NRPM vibration.
              r/R    Enables/disables  reverb effect controlling.
              c/C    Enables/disables chorus effect  controlling.
              c ratio
                     Sets the chorus effect value of all channels
                     to ratio.
              s/S    Enables/disables channel  pressure  control-
                     ling.
              t/T    Enables/disables   tracing   all  Text  Meta
                     Events.
              o/O    Accepts/rejects  pronouncing  multiple  same
                     notes.
              m HH   Sets  the  manufacture  ID to HH ( HH is the
                     two hex-digits ).
                     In addition if HH is GM/gm , GS/gs or  XG/xg
                     that are same as to 41 , 43 and 7e.
              B bank Sets  the  bank  number  of  all channels to
                     bank.

      -F      Turns  on  fast  panning to accommodate MIDI pieces
              that expect panning  adjustments  to  affect  notes
              that  are  already  playing.  Some files that don't
              expect  this  have  a  habit  of  flipping  balance
              rapidly  between  left  and  right, which can cause
              severe popping when the -F flag is used.
              In  current  versions  of  TiMidity++ this option are
              toggled.

      -f      Toggles fast envelopes. This option makes  TiMidity++
              do  fast  but  the  release  time  of the notes are
              shorten.

      -g sec  Open the Sound-Spectrogram window. This  option  is
              activated  if  the  system has support for X Window
              System.

      -h     Show the help message.

      -I voice[/c]
              Uses the program number as the default  instrument.
              Any  Program Change events in MIDI files will over-
              ride this option.
              If the voice followed by  /c  the  default  program
              number  of the channel c is specified by the voice.

      -i interface
              Selects the user interfaces  from  the  compiled-in
              alternatives.  interface  must be begun with one of
              the supported interface identifiers.  Run  TiMidity++
              with  the  -h  option to see a list.  The following
              identifiers may be available:
              -id    dumb interface
              -in    ncurses interface
              -is    slang interface
              -ia    X Athena Widget interface
              -ik    Tcl/Tk interface
              -im    motif interface
              -iT    vt100 interface
              -ie    Emacs  interface  (press  M-x  timidity   on
                     Emacs)
              -ii    skin interface
                     Environment  variable  TIMIDITY_SKIN must be
                     specified with path of  the  skin  data(com-
                     pressed data are also available).

              Interface options
                     Option characters may be  added  immediately
                     after the interface identifier.  The follow-
                     ing options are recognized:

              v      Increases  verbosity  level.  This option is
                     cumulative.
              q      Decreases verbosity level.  This  option  is
                     cumulative.
              t      Toggles  trace mode.  In trace  mode, TiMid-
                     ity attempts  to  display  its current state
                     in real time.  For the Linux  sound  driver,
                     this is  accomplished  through  the  use  of
                     short  DMA  buffer  fragments,  which can be
                     tuned via the -B option.

      -j      This option enables to load the  patch  file  while
              playing.

      -L  directory
              Adds directory to the library path.  Patch, config-
              uration, and  MIDI  files  are searched along  this
              path.  Directories  added  last  will  be  searched
              first.   Note  that the current directory is always
              searched first before the library path.

      -n degree
              Enables Noise Shaping Filter. degree is from 0(min)
              to 4(max).

      -O mode
              Selects the output mode from the compiled-in alter-
              natives.  mode must begin with one of the supported
              output mode identifiers.  Run TiMidity++ with the  -h
              option  to  see  a list.  The following identifiers
              should be available in all versions:
              -Od    Output via audio device (default)
              -Or    Generate  raw  waveform  data.   All  format
                     options   are   supported.   Common  formats
                     include:
                      -OrU   uLaw
                      -Or1sl 16-bit signed linear PCM
                      -Or8ul 8-bit unsigned linear PCM
              -Ou    Generate Sun Audio (au) file
              -Oa    Generate AIFF file
              -Ow    Generate RIFF WAVE format output.  If output
                     is  directed  to  a non-seekable file, or if
                     TiMidity++ is interrupted before  closing  the
                     file,   the   file   header   will   contain
                     0xFFFFFFFF in the RIFF and data block length
                     fields.   The popular sound conversion util-
                     ity sox  is  able  to  read  such  malformed
                     files,  so you can pipe data directly to sox
                     for on-the-fly conversion to other  formats.
              Format options
                     Option  characters  may be added immediately
                     after the mode identifier to change the out-
                     put  format.  The following options are rec-
                     ognized:
                      8      8-bit sample width
                      1      6-bit sample width
                      l      Linear encoding
                      U      uLaw (8-bit) encoding
                      M      Monophonic
                      S      Stereo
                      s      Signed output
                      u      Unsigned output
                      x      Byte-swapped output
              Note that some  options  have  no  effect  on  some
              modes.   For  example,  you cannot generate a byte-
              swapped RIFF WAVE file, or force uLaw output  on  a
              Linux PCM device.

      -o filename
              Place  output  on  filename,  which  may be a file,
              device, or HP-UX audio  server,  depending  on  the
              output  mode  selected with the -O option. The spe-
              cial filename ``-'' causes output to be  placed  on
              stdout.

      -p voices
              Sets  polyphony  (maximum  number  of  simultaneous
              voices) to voices.

      -Q channel
              Causes channel to be quiet.  If  channel  is  nega-
              tive, channel -channel is turned back on.  If chan-
              nel is 0, all channels are turned on.

      -R value
              Enables Pseudo Reverb Mode. value are  the  follow-
              ing:
              0      Long slight release
              1      Long loud release
              2      Short release
              3      No release

      -r      This options causes another reverb effects.

      -s frequency
              Sets  the resampling frequency(Hz or kHz).  Not all
              sound devices are capable of all frequencies --  an
              approximate frequency may be selected, depending on
              the implementation.

      -U      Instructs  TiMidity++  to unload all instruments from
              memory between MIDI files.  This can reduce  memory
              requirements when playing many files in succession.

      -w mode
	      Extend mode for MS-Windows. The following  options  are
	      available:
	      -wr  Use rcpcv.dll to play RCP/R36 files.
	      -wR  Not use rcpcv.dll (default).

      -W mode
	      Play with WRD file.  mode are the follwing:
	      x    X Window System mode
	      t    TTY mode
	      d    Dumb mode (outputs WRD events directry)
	      -    not traces WRD
              WRD mode must be with trace mode(option -i?t) or  timing  of
              WRD events are terrible.

      -WR[opts]
	      Sets WRD options:

	      a1=b1,a2=b2, ...
	          Sets the WRD options. an is the name of option and
	          bn is the value.

	      -WRd=n
	          Emulates timing(@WAIT,@WMODE) bugs of the original
	          MIMPI player.  The emulate level is following:
	          -WRd=0
		      not emulates any bugs of MIMPI
	          -WRd=1
		      only emulates some bugs (default)
	          -WRd=2
		      emulates all known bugs
	      -WRF=filename
	          Uses	filename     as	    WRD	    file     only
	          (input-file-name):r.wrd	(like  csh syntax) is not
	          available.
	      -WRf=filename
	          Uses filername as WRD file.

      -x string
              Configure  TiMidity++  by  the  string. The format of
              string is the same as timidity.cfg.
              For example:
              -x'bank 0\n0 violin.pat'
              Sets the instrument number 0 to violin.

*Play the MIDI file in archive file:

 TiMidity++ can play a file contained in various kinds of archive file. The
 following archive formats are supported:

  - tar           (*.tar)
  - gzipped tar   (*.tar.gz, *.tgz)
  - zip file      (*.zip)
  - lzh file      (*.lzh)

 If you want to specify a certain MIDI file in the archive, describe the
 #<MIDI-filename> expression following the archive name.  The
 expressions after the # are allowed to use regular expressions (case
 insensitive).  Note that the single quotes are needed to prevent the
 shell from misinterpreting the # character.  For example:

              timidity 'file.zip#file.mid'
                     Plays file.mid in file.zip

              timidity 'file.lzh#*.mid'
                     Plays  any  files that  match  the  regular
                     expression '*.mid' in file.zip

              timidity 'file.tgz#*'
                     This  expression is the same as 
                     timidity 'file.tgz'

*Play the MIDI file over a network
 TiMidity++ can access a file over a network. Supported network protocols
 include HTTP, FTP and NNTP(NetNews); specify these as http://foo,
 ftp://foo, and news://foo respectively.  An archived file is also
 accessible over a network.

 With NNTP, if you specify a newsgroup in the message-ID field TiMidity++
 plays all MIDI files posted in the specified newsgroup. These MIDI files
 must be encoded using uuencode or the Multipart encoded
 uuencode/base64/hexbin.
